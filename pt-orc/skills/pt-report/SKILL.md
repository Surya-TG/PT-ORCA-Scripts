# pt-report — Report Content Generator
*L2 — Loaded for S7 (report generation). Drop after report section(s) complete.*

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_RECEIVED — Received from L1 (pt-orc) | pt,report,received,l1,orc | L43-54

On dispatch, L1 passes:
- Findings index (full list of F-XX and OBS-XX from state snapshot)
- Finding stubs (from `working/<OrgCode>_Findings_vX.X.md`) — L1 fetches relevant stubs
- Engagement metadata (scope, type PTI/PTE, client, tester, dates)
- Severity distribution table
- Report version to produce
- Specific request: "write finding F-03", "draft section 2.3.1", "executive summary", etc.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_INPUTS — Input Sources | pt,report,inputs,input,sources | L55-94

### verify_summary_*.md (from 07_service_verify)
- **PRIMARY source** for service-level findings (DB NOAUTH, SSH CVE, FTP anon, web headers)
- Load before generating stubs for: database access, authentication, cleartext protocols
- Format: markdown tables with VULN / SAFE / UNKNOWN / MANUAL sections
- Evidence path per finding: `evidence/_verify/<ip>/<probe_type>_*.txt`
- Use VULN section rows directly as finding stubs — detail column → finding description
- UNKNOWN/MANUAL rows → flag for manual testing section of report; do not report as confirmed

### Finding Stub Templates from 07 Output

**DB NOAUTH → High finding stub (PTI) / Critical candidate (PTE):**
```
Title: Unauthenticated [MySQL/PostgreSQL/MSSQL] Access
Evidence: verify_summary VULN row + evidence/_verify/<ip>/[mysql|postgres|mssql]_noauth_*.txt
```

**SSH CVE-2024-6387 → High finding stub:**
```
Title: SSH regreSSHion Vulnerability Candidate (CVE-2024-6387)
Evidence: verify_summary VULN row + evidence/_verify/<ip>/ssh_version_*.txt
Note: "CANDIDATE" — exploitation requires race condition; confirm version before escalating
```

**FTP Anonymous → High finding stub:**
```
Title: FTP Anonymous Access Enabled
Evidence: verify_summary VULN row + evidence/_verify/<ip>/ftp_anon_*.txt
```

**Web Headers → Medium finding stub:**
```
Title: Missing HTTP Security Headers
Evidence: verify_summary VULN row + evidence/_verify/<ip>/web_generic_<port>_*.txt
Group all hosts missing same headers into one finding with affected hosts table
```

### JSONL input sources (all phases — preferred primary source from 12_report_pack)

Load `working/*_12_findings.jsonl` as the consolidated source. Each line is a complete finding record:
```json
{"id":"f-07-10_10_10_1-0001","title":"...","severity":"critical","phase":"07_service_verify",
 "evidence_ids":["ev-07-..."],"description":"...","recommendation":"...",
 "retest_status":"n/a","residual_risk":""}
```
- `severity` field maps directly to report severity — no re-rating without additional evidence
- `phase` field identifies source script for evidence path derivation
- `evidence_ids` → cross-reference to `evidence/` files for Appendix C evidence index
- Group findings by phase for section assignment, then by severity within each section

**Per-phase JSONL sources (use when 12 not yet run or for step-level detail):**
- `*_07_service_verify_findings_*.jsonl` — service probe findings (07)
- `*_08_app_api_findings_*.jsonl` — App/API review (08)
- `*_09_ai_llm_findings_*.jsonl` — AI/LLM assessment (09)
- `*_10_cloud_findings_*.jsonl` — cloud infrastructure (10)
- `*_11_ad_findings_*.jsonl` — Active Directory (11)

### Finding Stub Templates for VAPT-Enhanced Phases

**Cloud IMDS Access → Critical finding stub:**
```
Title: Cloud Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) Accessible via SSRF
Evidence: working/*_10_cloud_findings_*.jsonl (severity:critical) + evidence/<IP>/_cloud/imds_*.txt
Phase: Cloud Infrastructure (Step 10)
Note: Immediate credential rotation required if keys present in response
```

**S3/GCS/Azure Bucket Exposure → High–Critical finding stub:**
```
Title: Publicly Accessible Cloud Storage Bucket — [bucket-name]
Evidence: working/*_10_cloud_findings_*.jsonl + evidence/<IP>/_cloud/bucket_*.txt
Severity: Critical if sensitive data confirmed; High if empty/public-by-design
```

**Kerberoasting → High finding stub:**
```
Title: Kerberoastable Service Accounts Identified
Evidence: working/*_11_ad_findings_*.jsonl (severity:high) + evidence/<IP>/_ad/kerberoast_*.txt
Note: List SPNs in affected hosts; offline cracking vector — no exploitation required
```

**ADCS ESC1 → Critical finding stub:**
```
Title: Active Directory Certificate Services — ESC1 Privilege Escalation (ADCS)
Evidence: working/*_11_ad_findings_*.jsonl (severity:critical) + evidence/_ad/certipy_*.txt
Phase: Active Directory (Step 11)
Note: Full certipy find output as Appendix evidence
```

**AI/LLM Prompt Injection → Critical finding stub:**
```
Title: Prompt Injection — [Endpoint Name]
Evidence: working/*_09_ai_llm_findings_*.jsonl + evidence/<IP>/_llm/prompt_injection_*.txt
Note: Include payload and response excerpt; OWASP LLM01:2025 reference
```

**JWT Algorithm:None → Critical finding stub:**
```
Title: JWT Authentication Bypass — Algorithm:None Accepted
Evidence: working/*_08_app_api_findings_*.jsonl + evidence/<IP>/_api/jwt_*.txt
Phase: App/API Review (Step 08)
```

### PTE Report
```
Cover Page
Section 1 — Introduction
Section 2 — Findings
  2.2.1 DNS Reconnaissance
  2.2.2 Network Infrastructure
  2.2.3 TLS / Certificate Assessment
  2.2.4 Security Headers
  2.2.5 Outdated Software
  2.2.6 Authentication and Access Control
  2.2.7 WordPress Security          ← include only if WordPress assessed (06_wpscan.sh)
  2.2.8 Application and API Security ← include only if 08_app_api_review.sh run with findings
  2.2.9 AI/LLM Endpoint Security    ← include only if 09_ai_llm_review.sh run with findings
  2.2.10 Cloud Infrastructure       ← include only if 10_cloud_testing.sh run with findings
  [2.2.11+ additional categories if required]
Appendices
```

**PTE category sequence is fixed.** Do not reorder. Add categories after 2.2.6 only.
**WordPress (2.2.7):** Include this section only when `06_wpscan.sh` was run and produced findings. If WordPress was detected but not assessed (e.g. out of RoE), note in 1.3 Limitations instead. Typical findings grouped here: XML-RPC exposure, user enumeration, vulnerable plugins/themes, config file exposure, wp-admin access without rate limiting. Evidence from `evidence/_wpscan/<label>/`.
**PTI categories are thematic.** Group findings by technology/service area. Max 8
categories, ~15 findings across all.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_VERSIONING — Document Versioning | pt,report,versioning,document,version | L151-166

| Change type | Increment |
|---|---|
| Typo / minor fix | +0.01 |
| Multiple small fixes | +0.02–+0.03 |
| New finding or significant rewrite | +0.1 |
| Major restructure | +1.0 |
| Coordinated final release | Round to X.0 |

**CRITICAL:** Version must be bumped in BOTH the cover page field AND the filename
before every pack. Never reissue the same version number. Never skip incrementing.
This applies even for a single-field fix.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_HEADINGS — PTI Heading Structure | pt,report,headings,pti,heading | L167-186

### Section headings (Heading3)
Each thematic section (2.3.x) gets a Heading3. Example:
```
2.3.1. Network Segmentation and OT Boundary Failures
2.3.2. Unauthenticated Access to OT Devices
```

### Finding headings (Heading4)
Each individual finding gets a Heading4 immediately above its severity table.
Format: `2.3.x.y. F-YY — <Short title matching summary table>`

Heading4 style: bold, navy (#1F3864), 11pt. Not italic, not blue — override Word default.

The Heading4 subsection number must also appear in the **Findings Summary table**
Section column (e.g. 2.3.1.3, not just 2.3.1).

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_EXEC_SUMMARY — Executive Summary | pt,report,exec,summary,executive | L187-225

Write last. Structure:

1. **Engagement overview** (1–2 sentences): what was tested, when, by whom.
2. **Overall posture** (2–3 sentences): high-level characterisation. Reference severity
   distribution. Do not list individual findings.
3. **Three bold callouts** — the most significant risk themes. Each callout:
   - Opens with a **bold statement** of the risk (not a finding title)
   - Followed by 3–5 sentences of plain-English explanation
   - References specific F-XX numbers inline (not in parenthetical footnotes)
   - Includes concrete details (IP counts, storage sizes, CVE numbers where material)
   - Does NOT name tools, scan dates, or methodology
4. **Immediate priority list** — 4–6 bullet points with F-XX references.

**Bold callout tone:** Direct, specific, risk-forward. Not alarmist. Not vague.
Each callout should tell a non-technical executive exactly what is broken and why it matters.

**Example structure (not content):**
```
**OT network segmentation is effectively absent.** Five independent confirmed bridges
exist between the corporate LAN and the OT/calibration subnet: [specifics]. One bridge
additionally [compound risk]. [Consequence sentence]. F-01, F-02, F-03.

**OT devices accept unauthenticated remote access.** [Device name and IP] accepts
[access type] and allows [confirmed capability]. [Specific risk to operations].
F-04, F-05.

**The perimeter firewall patch status is unverified against critical-severity CVEs.**
[Device] is confirmed as a model affected by [CVE, CVSS score]. [Attack surface].
[Consequence if unpatched]. F-07.
```

Tone: professional, direct, non-alarmist. Readable by a non-technical executive.
**No tool names. No scan dates. IP addresses MAY appear in callouts for specificity.**
CVE numbers MAY appear in callouts when the severity/score is the key risk driver.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_BODY_RULES — Finding Body Writing Rules | pt,report,body,rules,finding | L226-271
<!-- NAV-RULE: read-toc-first -->

These rules are derived from Greg's editing style across the WTech PTI engagement.
They override any general guidance where they conflict.

### What to include
- What was found and where (device, IP, service, port)
- How it was confirmed (one clean sentence — no tool names, no dates, no file refs)
- The specific risk to this client's environment
- Concrete detail: IP addresses, storage sizes, version strings, CVE numbers
- Write access / read access distinction — always state which was confirmed

### What to exclude
- Tool names in finding bodies (nmap, enum4linux, services-f3.csv, etc.)
- Scan dates (2026-04-07, D-05 verification, etc.)
- File references (services-f3.csv, goahead_banner_20260407T1125.txt, etc.)
- Internal tracking codes (C-01, D-05, D-06, etc.)
- Methodology narrative ("during passive capture", "Phase 1/2 enumeration")
- Scanning methodology language ("confirmed by NSE script", "returned by db_nmap")
- Verbose technical acronym explanations (SCPI, SAMR — use them without explaining)
- Duplicate recommendations (check for overlap before adding)

### Tone and structure
- State the risk clearly without storytelling
- Bold the sub-finding title; follow immediately with the evidence-based body
- 2–4 sentences per sub-finding — tight, factual, outcome-focused
- Recommendations: outcome-focused verbs, specific config paths where known

### Host(s) table cell
- Always list specific IPs — never "Multiple hosts" without IPs
- For large host lists (10+): group by subnet prefix, list last octets only
  Format: `192.168.1.x — .15 · .25 · .39 · .71 · [...]`
          `192.168.10.x — .5 · .6 · .10`
          `Signing enforced on 192.168.1.48 only` (italic, separate line)
- Notable hosts: call out role inline (e.g. `.243 (PCRDP) · .245 (SRV2019_2)`)
- OBS Host(s) cells: populate with confirmed IPs from evidence — never leave as
  "Multiple hosts" without the actual list

### Confidence cell
- Do not include scan dates, file names, or verification session codes
- State the confirmation method in plain terms: "anonymous FTP login confirmed;
  write access demonstrated by successful directory creation"

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_OBSERVATIONS — Observations Writing Rules | pt,report,observations,writing,rules | L272-283

- 2–4 sentences max
- Factual, neutral — no risk language, no recommendations
- No tool names, no dates, no file references, no internal tracking codes
- No SCPI explanations, no Italian app names, no URL paths unless essential
- No "was not assessed" repeated multiple times — state once what was not assessed
- No "during passive capture" — just state what was observed
- Host(s) cell: always specific IPs, never "Multiple hosts" alone

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_IDENTITY — Device Identity Verification Rule | pt,report,identity,device,verification | L284-304

**Always verify device identity from evidence before writing any finding.**
Nmap service banners are frequently wrong. The following are known failure modes:

- **Telnet service label** — nmap commonly misidentifies generic login prompts
  (User name / Password) as specific device types (e.g. "HP Integrated Lights Out
  telnetd"). This is a false positive pattern. Always cross-reference with:
  - MAC OUI (primary — confirms vendor)
  - OS fingerprint from hosts export (ZyNOS, ZyXEL = Zyxel device)
  - FTP banner (often names the actual device/vendor)
  - Browser login page screenshot (definitive)
- **iLO / BMC identification** — requires confirmed MAC OUI (HP = 3C:D9:2B etc.)
  plus management interface login page. A telnet banner alone is not sufficient.
- **When identity is wrong in an early version** — correct ALL occurrences:
  finding title, H4 heading, summary table, finding body, all recommendations,
  cross-references in other findings (e.g. F-19 "outdated components"), appendix
  evidence index entries, appendix screenshot captions.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_PENDING — Pending Actions Pre-Delivery Checklist | pt,report,pending,actions,pre | L305-329

The checklist table lives in Appendix B (or C depending on template). It tracks:
- **Blocking items** (🔴 BLOCKING) — report cannot be finalized without these
- **Required client actions** (🔴 REQUIRED) — client must act before delivery

Rules:
- This table must NOT appear in the Severity Grading Table (2.1) — if an orphaned
  row appears there, delete it and add to the checklist instead
- Completed items are removed from the checklist (not marked done)
- New tester artefacts requiring client cleanup are added as 🔴 REQUIRED rows
- Each artefact row names the specific file/directory, the host IP, and the method
  to remove it (e.g. "QNAP management interface or authenticated NFS session")

**Standard artefact cleanup row format:**
```
Item:   TechGuard IT artefact on .<last_octet>
Status: 🔴 REQUIRED
Detail: <Directory/file name> created at <path> on <IP> during active testing
        (<confirmation method>). Cannot be removed by tester session. Client must
        delete manually via <method> before report delivery (F-XX).
```

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_SUMMARY_TABLE — Findings Summary Table | pt,report,summary,table,findings | L330-344

The Section column must use **full subsection numbers** (2.3.x.y), not section numbers
(2.3.x). These correspond to the Heading4 subsections added above each finding's
severity table.

Example:
```
High | NFS World-Readable Exports (~21 TB) (F-03) | 2.3.1.3
High | Dual-NIC QNAP OT Bridge (F-01)             | 2.3.1.1
High | SMB Signing Not Enforced (F-08)             | 2.3.3.2
```

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_SEVERITY — Severity Classification | pt,report,severity,classification,colors | L345-366

| Severity | Hex | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | #7B1C2E | RCE, unauthenticated privileged access, exfiltration path, data destruction |
| High | #C25B6E | Strong path to Critical, auth bypass, sensitive data exposure, exploitable misconfiguration |
| Medium | #C47C3A | Exploitable with credentials or chaining, information disclosure, weak auth |
| Low | #8FAF6E | Minor misconfiguration, hardening gap, limited exploitability |
| Informational | #4A7BA7 | No direct risk; context for assessor or client |
| Observation | — | No severity assigned; informational only |

**PTI scale:** No Critical tier — High is the highest. Finding severity tops at High
for internal engagements unless engagement scope explicitly permits Critical.

Applied as: left border stripe + filled circle indicator in Word. **Never coloured text.**
Body text always #000000. Header text in report always #000000 (not styled to severity colour).

**Header "Confidential" label:** Must be navy (#1F3864), not severity red. This is a
common error — check header1.xml when building or editing the template.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_FINDING_TEMPLATE — Finding Body Template | pt,report,finding,template,body | L367-399

Every finding body follows this structure exactly. Adapt content; do not adapt structure.

```markdown
### F-XX — <Title> [Precautionary — if applicable]

**Severity:** High / Medium / Low / Informational   ← no Critical in PTI
**Confidence:** CERTAIN / LIKELY / UNCERTAIN
**Affected Systems:** <specific IP list — never "Multiple hosts" alone>
**CVE:** <CVE-YYYY-NNNNN> / N/A

---

#### Finding(s)

1. **F-XX — <Sub-finding title>:** <Body. What was found, where, what it means.
   No tool names, no dates, no file refs. Evidence-based only. 2–4 sentences.>

2. **F-XX — <Second sub-finding if applicable>:** <Same format.>

#### Recommendation(s)

1. <Action verb> <specific action>. <Config path or method if known.>
2. <Action verb> <specific action.>
```

**Precautionary findings:** Add `[Precautionary]` to title. State explicitly in body:
*"The firmware version could not be confirmed by any unauthenticated method. This finding
is rated [severity] on a precautionary basis and will be reviewed upon receipt of [D-XX]."*

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_OBS_TEMPLATE — Observation Body Template | pt,report,obs,template,observation | L400-416

```markdown
### OBS-XX — <Title>

**Affected Systems:** <specific IPs>

<2–4 sentences. Factual. No risk language. No recommendations.
No tool names. No dates. No internal codes.>

*Informational observation. No remediation action required.*
```

No Recommendation section. No severity. If action is needed, promote to a Finding.

---

## MRK:PT_REPORT_RETEST — Re-test Documentation (S8) | pt,report,retest,re,test | L417-440

When re-testing previously reported findings, document the delta only.

```markdown
### F-XX — <Original Title> — Re-test

**Re-test date:** <date>
**Original report version:** <vX.X>
**Remediation status:** Resolved / Partially resolved / Not resolved

#### Re-test Evidence
<What was tested, how, what result was observed. No tool names in summary.>

Evidence file: `evidence/<IP>/retest_<TS>/<tool>_<TS>.txt`

#### Verdict
- **Resolved:** Vulnerability no longer present. <Brief confirmation.>
- **Partially resolved:** <What was fixed, what remains.>
- **Not resolved:** Finding stands. Original evidence and recommendation unchanged.
```

## MRK:PT_REPORT_SEC1 — Section 1 Introduction Templates | pt,report,sec1,section,introduction | L441-486

### 1.1 Scope and Objectives

```
TechGuard. was engaged by <Client> to conduct a <PTI/PTE>
penetration test of <scope description>. The assessment was conducted between
<start date> and <end date>.

The objectives of this engagement were to:
- Identify vulnerabilities within the assessed environment
- Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce risk

[PTI:] The internal assessment covered <N> hosts across <N> subnets.
[PTE:] The external assessment covered <N> confirmed in-scope IP addresses across <N> domains.
```

### 1.2 Methodology

```
Testing was conducted in accordance with industry-standard methodologies, incorporating
elements of OWASP, PTES, and NIST SP 800-115. The engagement proceeded through the
following phases: reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability assessment, and
[exploitation / validation — if applicable under RoE].

All testing was performed from [tester network position]. No social engineering or
physical testing was performed unless explicitly noted.
```

### 1.3 Limitations

```
This assessment represents a point-in-time evaluation. The security posture of the
environment may change after the assessment date.

[Add if applicable:]
- Certain hosts were excluded from active testing at the client's request: <list>
- Exploitation was limited by the Rules of Engagement to [describe limitation]
- Domain authentication enumeration required domain credentials not available during
  this engagement; targeted follow-up is recommended.
- [Any other scoping limitation]
```

| F-01 | evidence/<IP>/manual_<desc>_<TS>.txt | manual | <what was confirmed> |
```

Screenshot captions in Appendix D: when a nmap service label is a known false positive
(e.g. "HP Integrated Lights Out telnetd" on a Zyxel switch), note it explicitly in the
caption: *"The Telnet service was incorrectly labeled by nmap as [label] — a false
positive on the generic login prompt. Right pane: browser confirms [actual device]."*

## MRK:PT_REPORT_PITFALLS — Common Pitfalls | pt,report,pitfalls,common,mistakes | L519-542

| Pitfall | Correct approach |
|---|---|
